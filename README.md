# NumPy Practice

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates fundamental operations and features of the **NumPy** library in Python. The notebook is designed to help beginners understand core NumPy concepts through hands-on examples.

## File

- `Numpy_Practice.ipynb`: A practice notebook covering key NumPy functionalities.

## Topics Covered

### Array Creation
- Creating 1D, 2D, and 3D arrays
- Using `arange()`, `linspace()`, and random number generation

### Array Operations
- Element-wise arithmetic
- Matrix multiplication
- Broadcasting

### Indexing and Slicing
- Basic slicing and indexing
- Fancy indexing and boolean indexing

### Array Manipulation
- Reshaping arrays
- Concatenation and splitting
- Transposing

### Mathematical and Statistical Functions
- Aggregate functions: `sum()`, `mean()`, `std()`, etc.
- Axis-based operations
- Universal functions (ufuncs)

### Other Utilities
- Array comparison
- Logical operations
- Performance benefits of NumPy over lists

## How to Run

To open and run the notebook:

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Install Jupyter and NumPy if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install notebook numpy
